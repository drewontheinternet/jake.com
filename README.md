Man.... Have you seen this guy?

Hey there, Drew here...

I learned a couple two three things about HTML and CSS and this is my first go at making something from scratch.

God those flex-boxes were difficult but now it feels like i can put any div anywhere and make that thing flex.

Im going to try and add some extra fonts/images/shapes to really see what I can make.

This is a website.... about my friend jake :)
